# Meta (Facebook) Ad Account Balance Viewer

## Scenario

We want a small internal dashboard that shows current ad accounts and their balances from Meta (Facebook) for connected FB Account.
The goal is to test how you handle API calls with Meta and data display using **Next.js**.

## Task

Build a simple app that:

- Connects to the **Meta Graph API**
- Fetches the list of available ad accounts with relevant fields
- Displays each account’s **name**, **currency**, and **actual balance** as shown in Ads Manager
- Handles **loading** and **error** states cleanly

## What We Care About

- Clear, readable code
- Logical use of the Meta API
- Simple and functional UI
- Correctly determining the **balance displayed in Ads Manager**

## Deliverable

Provide the **source code** for the app and brief **setup instructions**.  
No database is needed — just a direct connection to the Meta API.
